# About

This is a test project to learn new things

# Development

## [VS Code dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

This project is setup to fully work from inside a docker container via VS Code. It is highly recommended to use this process in order to be fully setup instantly.

_Requirements_

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   [VS Code Remote Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)

Once installed, you should be able to open VS Code at the repository root and it will prompt you to open it in a container. If not you should be able to open the command panel (ctrl+shift p) and type `Remote Containers: Open folder in container` which will trigger the process.
